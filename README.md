This code can be used to predict the lightcurve of a highly-magnified star in the presence of a random Gaussian noise in the lens due to small-scale dark matter substructure. The macro lens model is that of a fold caustic with convergence perturbations drawn from a power spectrum corresponding to "monochromatic" distribution of dark matter minihalos. This code is based on work with Cristiano Sampaio during the summer of 2024.
